## Merit Badges

The ATXFC Cut Crew merit badge program is live!

If you attend an away match, you should also be given a card with redemption
instructions. Mailing that card to the address on the card **along with a
self-addressed stamp envelope** will result in you being mailed back the merit
badge. There's no additional cost to you! If you didn't get a card, or if you
have any other questions about the program, you can email us at
[meritbadges@atxfccutcrew.com](mailto:meritbadges@atxfccutcrew.com) or ask in
the #team-merit-badges channel in the Los Verdes slack!
