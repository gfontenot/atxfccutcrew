## Merit Badges

We're doing a trial run of our away-day merit badge program ahead of our full launch in the 2024 season. If you go to an away match that we're offering a merit badge for, you should also be given a card with redemption instructions. Mailing that card to the address on the card **along with a self-addressed stamp envelope** will result in you being mailed back the merit badge. There's no additional cost to you! If you didn't get a card, or if you have any other questions about the program, you can email us at [meritbadges@atxfccutcrew.com](mailto:meritbadges@atxfccutcrew.com) or ask in #project-merit-badges in the Los Verdes slack!
